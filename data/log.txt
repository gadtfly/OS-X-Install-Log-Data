    [Note: macbook clock observed to be 5-10 seconds ahead of phone, where notes are being recorded and time being (loosely) taken]
    [Note: observation(s?) lost due to phone/Google Keep fuckup somehow (cursor placed here, apparently with text selected go be overwritten while typing several screens down, like 20 minutes later); no undo available]

    [okay: “User info context values set for adamlouis” is the moment of login]

End manual log.  From here on (based on probably unwarranted assumptions, but fuck it):
  Can distinguish from log content: Power On -> Login
  Will wait 2 minutes after login to save `ps Au`, which will note in the filename what happened in the previous session that has just been rebooted from, with a timestamp of the log creation
  Possibly do this twice for each action… but will probably find too tedious, so probably not
  Console Logs are strictly additive, so I only need one at the end (retroactive, i.e. shit’s getting deleted, so I really hope this is true because I’m not reinstalling again)
  Actions will first be 100% native, no-3rd-party, config stuff, then 3rd party apps and config, 1 thing at a time (per reboot+logging)
