## OS X Install Log Data

Contains:
* `ps` output from fresh reboots after various install/config actions
* `/var/log` dump from first 2 days of usage
* Handwritten notes, to cross-reference times of various parts of initial install with logs

Ambition to, at some point in the future, further parse, organize, and analyze this stuff, in an attempt to explore:

* Where bloat comes from
* Why a totally virgin fresh OS X install on authorized hardware leaves a log littered with thousands of errors
* Other ownership-and-control-related anxieties that have lead me to seriously consider switching to Arch

Conducted about as methodically as a forest fire, because I needed to actually use the system during the process, and it was tedious as hell to even do it to this extremely low of consistency.
